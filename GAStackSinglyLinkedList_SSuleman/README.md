### Guided Assignment - Stack Using Singly Linked List
### Introduction
 ```csharp
 ## A. What is a Stack?
   i. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, 
      that means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. 
      It can be visualized as a stack of plates where you can only add or remove the top one.
  ii. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the top only. 
      - The operations of adding an element to the stack are called "push" operations, 
      - The removing an element from the stack is called a "pop" operation. 
      Additionally, we can usually peek at the top element of the stack without removing it.

### 1. Explanation of a Stack and Its Utility:
```csharp
   A. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
      It is used to store elements in a way that the last element added is the first one to be removed.
      Stacks are commonly used in many algorithms and applications like expression evaluation, 
      backtracking, function call management, etc.
   B. The primary utility of a queue lies in its ability to manage data in a sequential manner, 
      ensuring that elements are processed in the order they are added.

```
### 2. Differences between a stack and a singly linked list?

````csharp
 -- Stack and singly linked list are both data structures, but they serve different purposes 
    and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between them:

  1. Purpose:
     i. Stack: A stack is a specialized data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
        It is used for storing elements and supporting two primary operations: 
        push (to add an element to the top of the stack) and pop (to remove the top element from the stack).
    ii. Singly Linked List: A singly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements 
        where each element points to the next one in the sequence. It supports various operations 
        such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

  2. Operations:
     i. Stack: Stacks support push (to add an element), pop (to remove the top element), 
        and peek (to view the top element without removing it).
    ii. Singly Linked List: Singly linked lists support operations like insertion (at the beginning, end, or middle), 
        deletion (of a specific element), traversal (to visit each element in sequence), 
        and searching (to find a specific element).
 
  3. Access Pattern:
     i. Stack: Stacks have restricted access patterns. Elements can only be added or removed from one end (the top).
    ii. Singly Linked List: Singly linked lists allow for more flexible access patterns. 
        Elements can be inserted or deleted at any position within the list.

  4. Memory Allocation:
     i. Stack: Stacks typically use contiguous memory allocation, where each 
        new element is added on top of the previous one.
    ii. Singly Linked List: Singly linked lists use dynamic memory allocation, 
        where each element is stored in a separate node, and nodes are linked together via pointers.
 
  5. Performance:
    i. Stack: Stacks offer constant-time complexity (O(1)) for push, pop, and peek operations 
       since they involve only updating the top element.
   ii. Singly Linked List: Singly linked lists offer constant-time complexity (O(1)) for insertion 
       and deletion at the beginning of the list, but linear-time complexity (O(n)) for insertion 
       and deletion at arbitrary positions, as it requires traversal to find the insertion/deletion point.

  6. Memory Overhead:
    i. Stack: Stacks have lower memory overhead since they do not require additional pointers for linking elements.
   ii. Singly Linked List: Singly linked lists have higher memory overhead due to 
       the additional pointers needed to link elements

### 3. Discuss scenarios where a stack is preferable over other data structures.
```csharp

  -- Stacks are preferable over other data structures in various scenarios 
     where the Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior is desirable. 
     Here are some common scenarios where stacks are particularly useful:

   a. Memory Management: 
      - Stacks are widely used in programming for memory management. 
        Function calls and local variables in many programming languages are managed using a stack. 
        Each function call adds a new frame to the stack, and 
        when the function returns, its frame is removed from the stack.

   b. Expression Evaluation: 
      - Stacks are used in evaluating expressions, especially infix, postfix, and prefix expressions.
        They allow for the efficient processing of mathematical expressions, 
        including arithmetic operations and nested expressions.

   c. Undo Mechanisms: 
      - Stacks are used in implementing undo mechanisms in applications such as
        text editors, graphics software, and web browsers. 
        Each action performed is pushed onto the stack, and 
        undoing an action involves popping items from the stack.

   d. Backtracking Algorithms: 
      - Stacks are essential in backtracking algorithms, 
        which involve exploring various paths to find a solution to a problem. 
        As the algorithm progresses, it pushes choices onto the stack and 
        backtracks when necessary by popping choices from the stack.

   e. Parsing and Syntax Analysis: 
      - Stacks are used in parsing and syntax analysis of programming languages. 
        They help in tracking the structure of expressions, statements, and 
        program blocks during compilation.

### 4. Considerations for choosing between a stack and other data structures.

````csharp
  -- When choosing between a stack and other data structures, several considerations come into play, 
     including the nature of the problem we are solving, the operations we need to perform frequently,
     memory and time complexity considerations, and the ease of implementation and maintenance.
     Here are some key considerations:
   
   a. LIFO (Last In, First Out) Requirement: 
      - If our problem naturally fits the Last In, First Out (LIFO) ordering, 
        a stack is likely the best choice. For example, function call stack management, 
        backtracking algorithms, and expression evaluation often benefit from a stack.

   b. Space Efficiency: 
     - Stacks tend to be relatively memory-efficient compared to other data structures 
       because they only store references to the elements. However, if space efficiency is a concern 
       and we need random access to elements, an array or a linked list might be a better choice.

   c. Time Complexity: 
     - Consider the time complexity of the operations we need to perform frequently. 
       Stacks typically offer constant time complexity O(1) for insertion (push) and deletion (pop) operations, 
       but accessing elements at arbitrary positions (like in an array) may be slower.

   d. Language and Library Support: 
     - Consider the programming language we are using and the available libraries or built in data structures it offers.
       Some languages provide built-in support for stacks, making them convenient to use, 
       others might require to implement a stack from the scratch.

### 5. Thoughts on implementing a stack using different approaches (array vs. linked list).

```csharp
  -- Implementing a stack using different approaches, such as arrays and linked lists, 
     offers distinct advantages and considerations:

    1. Array-based Stack:

      i. Advantages:
         - Random access: 
             Arrays allow for constant-time access to elements by index, 
             making it efficient to access the top element of the stack.
         - Contiguous memory allocation: 
             Arrays provide contiguous memory allocation, which can lead to better cache locality 
             and potentially better performance.
      
     ii. Considerations:
         - Dynamic resizing: 
             If the size of the stack exceeds the capacity of the underlying array, 
             resizing operations may be needed, which can be time-consuming and 
             may involve copying elements to a new array.
         - Inefficient insertion and deletion: 
             Insertions and deletions (push and pop operations) at arbitrary positions within the array 
             can be inefficient, especially if the stack is large and elements need to be shifted.
    
    2. Linked List-based Stack:

     i. Advantages:
        - Dynamic resizing: 
            Linked lists dynamically resize as needed, avoiding the need for resizing operations.
        - Efficient insertions and deletions: 
            Insertions and deletions at the beginning (push and pop operations for a stack) are always constant time in a linked list.
        - No fixed capacity: 
            Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically based on the number of elements, avoiding wasted memory.
   
   ii. Considerations:
        - Pointer overhead: 
            Each node in a linked list requires additional memory overhead for storing pointers/references,
            which can increase memory usage.
        - Less cache-friendly: 
            Linked lists may exhibit worse cache performance compared to arrays due to non-contiguous memory allocation, 
            especially in large stacks.
        - No random access: 
            Unlike arrays, linked lists do not support constant-time random access to elements, 
            so accessing elements at the top of the stack requires traversing the list from the head.
